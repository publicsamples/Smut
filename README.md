# Smut

Smut emerged from the decaying corpse of Shapey, a short lived experiment in oscillator driven file manipulation. Unlike its previous host, Smut  is a semi-modular synthesiser with deep cross modulation options and the ability to freely route between the different modules. Generally speaking, Smut has a dirty, unpredictable quality and offers many opportunities for unrestrained chaos, however in the right hands it can brought to heel and made to sound rather pleasant.
