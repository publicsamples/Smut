# Smut

![Smut](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/publicsamples/Smut/main/Smut.png)

Smut is a semi-modular synthesizer with deep fm and cross modulation options. Smut has three main sound generators, 8 freely routable modulation sources and a lush sounding reverb. 

The "modules"

Dual Oscillator 

Two sawtooth generators each with comprehensive waveshaping and fm controls:

Step - Set quantisation of both the pitch controls
Pitch - Determines the pitch of the oscillator 
Bend - Applies a on-note pitch glide
FM Source - selects an input source 
Input - The FM input amount
Shape - Select a waveshaper
Width - A meta parameter for the waveshaper, performs different functions dependent on selected shape

File

Four crossfadable sample players that derive their clock from either the oscillators, the modulators or some combination of both. Depending on how things are configured, they can act as waveshapers, lofi-samplers, or simple, non-interpolated wavetable players. 


File Menu - select a sample
File manager - opens the file manager allowing for selection of internal samples
User Mode - switches the samplers into user mode
Folder Select - Selects a user folder to populate the file menu
Position 1-4 - sets the start position for the selected sampler
Fade Mode - select one of three crossfade modes, or put the sample player into mix mode
X-Fade - controls the position of the crossfader
Quantise - Steps the output of the position control, useful when working with wavetables
Global Position - sets the start position of all samplers
Osc 1 In - The signal from oscillator 1
Osc 2 In - The signal from oscillator 2
In Offset - Offsets the signal from both oscillators 
Cutoff - apples a 1 pole lp/hp filter to the signal from both oscillators
lp/hp - switches the filter mode
Pitch Shifter - applies a delay based pitch shifter to the file player 
Pitch - the pitch of the pitch shifter
Feedback - applies feedback to the delay lines
Window - the window length of the delay lines
